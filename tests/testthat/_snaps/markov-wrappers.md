# Markov wrappers reject legacy starting-profile arguments

    Condition
      Error:
      ! vglm_markov() no longer accepts legacy wrapper argument(s): `start_time`, `origin_time`, `time_map`. Use `first_followup_time` to select the stored starting profiles; supply baseline and time-mapping arguments to downstream SOP summary functions.

# automatic SOP prediction never substitutes a later profile row

    Condition
      Error:
      ! Fitted patient(s) have incomplete starting-profile predictors: 1. The transition response is not required, but ID, modeled predictors, time metadata, and the previous state must be complete.
