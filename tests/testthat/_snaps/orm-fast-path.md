# orm fast path validates state support and initial probabilities

    Condition
      Error:
      ! `y_levels` defines 5 states, but the fitted model defines 6 states through 5 threshold coefficients.

      Error:
      ! Model prediction requires transitions from state level(s) not represented in the fitted transition data: 6. If a level is absorbing, pass it via `absorb`.
