Markov Ordinal State Transition models.

Derived from [markov.misc](https://github.com/scjohannes/markov.misc), retaining
its original authorship and GPL (>= 2) license. This package focuses on Markov
modeling, prediction, diagnostics, and inference.

Compute and plot state occupancy probabilities (SOPs) and contrasts from first- and second-order Markov models of ordinal health-state trajectories.

## Installation

Install the development version from GitHub with `pak`:

```r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("scjohannes/mostr")
```

## ACTT-2-Style SOP Workflow

This example simulates ACTT-2-style ordinal outcomes, fits a proportional-odds
Markov transition model with `orm_markov()`, estimates marginal treatment-arm
SOPs, adds uncertainty, and plots the result.

```r
library(mostr)
library(rms)
library(ggplot2)

set.seed(20260526)

trial <- sim_actt2_markov(
  n_patients = 300,
  follow_up_time = 28,
  treatment_prob = 0.5,
  treatment_effect = -0.03,
  seed = 20260526
)

markov_data <- prepare_markov_data(trial, absorbing_state = 8)

dd <- datadist(markov_data)
options(datadist = "dd")

fit <- orm_markov(
  y ~ rms::rcs(time, 4) + tx + yprev,
  data = markov_data,
  id_var = "id",
  type = "HC0",
  cadjust = TRUE,
  opt_method = "LM",
  scale = TRUE
)

sop <- avg_sops(
  fit,
  variables = list(tx = c(0, 1)),
  times = 1:28,
  y_levels = fit$yunique,
  absorb = "8"
)

sop_ci <- inferences(
  sop,
  method = "mvn",
  n_draws = 200,
  conf_level = 0.95
)

plot_sops(sop_ci, facet_var = "tx") +
  labs(
    x = "Day",
    y = "State occupancy probability"
  )
```

## Analytical Confidence Intervals

The default inference method remains `method = "mvn"`. For a deterministic
first-order delta-method calculation, reuse the same averaged full
proportional-odds SOP object (`sop`, created above by `avg_sops()`) and state the
variance estimate explicitly:

```r
sop_conditional <- inferences(
  sop,
  method = "delta",
  vcov = "conditional"
)

sop_unconditional <- inferences(
  sop,
  method = "delta",
  vcov = "unconditional"
)

# Extract variances and covariances for the first eight estimates.
V <- stats::vcov(sop_unconditional, rows = 1:8)
```

Conditional variance accounts for coefficient estimation while treating the
patients' starting states and covariates used for prediction as given.
Unconditional variance also accounts for which patients were sampled and their
role in estimating those coefficients. It is the default for averaged results
and requires the patients stored with the fitted model. Supplied `newdata`
requires `vcov = "conditional"`. Both choices give the same point estimates.

`orm_markov(id_var = "id")` and `vglm_markov(id_var = "id")` preserve
one first-follow-up profile per fitted patient before response-driven row
omission. `first_followup_time` selects that row only: for numeric time its
`NULL` default resolves to 1, time 1 must exist, and values below 1 are rejected;
factor or character time requires an explicit value. A missing first transition
response is allowed when ID, predictors, and `yprev` are complete and the
patient contributes another usable likelihood transition. The same automatic
profiles support `sops()`, `avg_sops()`, and `avg_comparisons()` when `newdata`
is omitted.

Both frequentist wrappers expose the same empirical sandwich correction
controls. `type = "HC0"` applies no row degrees-of-freedom correction, whereas
`type = "HC1"` multiplies by `(n - 1) / (n - p)`. For weighted ORM fits, `n`
and `G` count only positive-weight represented rows and clusters. Independently,
`cadjust = TRUE` multiplies by `G / (G - 1)`; its `NULL` default resolves to
`TRUE` when patient clustering is requested. `orm_markov()` computes this
sandwich inside `mostr` from analytic ORM row scores and the full
model-based bread, including fitted case weights. Penalized ORM fits using
`var.penalty = "sandwich"` use the retained `var.from.info.matrix` inverse
sensitivity as bread. These settings affect conditional analytical variance and MVN inference.
Unconditional variance uses its own patient-level sample-covariance correction;
`type` and `cadjust` do not change it.

Use `orm_markov()`, `vglm_markov()`, or `blrm_markov()` for package model-based
SOP and diagnostic workflows. Raw `rms`, `VGAM`, or `rmsb` fits do not carry the
wrapper provenance and stored-data contracts those workflows now require.

Real-time summaries are configured downstream rather than in the fitting
wrapper. `baseline_time = 0` places the observed `yprev` distribution at
baseline (`NULL` disables this anchor), `time_map` maps factor visits to elapsed
time, and `target_times` defines the returned and integrated grid. For example,
with the first modeled SOP mapped to day 7, `target_times = 1:28` interpolates
from the observed day-0 distribution to day 7 but integrates only days 1--28.
When `target_times` is omitted, time-in-state summaries integrate the mapped
follow-up nodes and exclude the baseline interval.

Patient-cluster robustness protects the variance against arbitrary within-patient
score correlation; it does not correct transition-model bias, informative
observation, or Markov/proportional-odds misspecification.

For analytical inference, omitted `vcov` (or `NULL`) selects `"unconditional"`
for averaged SOPs and comparisons, and `"conditional"` for individual `sops()`.
Individual results support only conditional inference. A custom coefficient
covariance matrix also selects conditional inference. Supplied `newdata`
requires an explicit conditional choice; unsupported unconditional inference
errors without falling back. The `target` argument has been removed.

## Data Provenance

The included `violet_baseline` dataset is derived from `Hmisc::simlongord`,
created by Frank Harrell and based on the VIOLET trial. Because that data
provenance is GPL-compatible, `mostr` is licensed as `GPL (>= 2)`.

`sim_actt2_markov(follow_up_time = 60)` generates 60-day trajectories;
follow-up beyond 28 days extrapolates the fitted time effect.
