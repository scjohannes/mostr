# mostr 0.1.0

* `plot_correlation()` now uses a 0-1 color scale when all available correlations
  are nonnegative, retaining -1 to 1 when negative correlations are present.
  Set `fill_limits` explicitly to keep a common scale across plots.

* Speed up row assembly, grouped summaries, patient bootstrap materialization,
  and baseline selection using data.table internally. Results remain data frames.

* Initial release of Markov Ordinal State Transition modeling tools, migrated
  from markov.misc with its original authorship and GPL license preserved.
* Retain Markov data generation, first- and second-order transition models,
  state occupancy probabilities, treatment comparisons, time in state,
  diagnostics, and analytical, posterior, MVN, and bootstrap inference.
* Remove non-Markov generators, simulation-study and power workflows, Arrow
  sampling, endpoint conversions, competing-risk analyses, and coefficient
  tidiers. The simulation-truth helper `calc_time_in_state_diff()` is also
  excluded; model-based summaries remain available through `time_in_state()`.
* Use Markov-generated data throughout examples, tests, and all nine vignettes.
* `sim_actt2_markov()` supports custom follow-up, including 60 days; the separate
  Brownian-calibrated 60-day generator is excluded.
