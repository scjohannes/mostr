# mostr 0.1.0

* `avg_sops()` now accepts `variables = NULL` to average over patients using
  their observed starting states and covariates, with the existing analytical,
  posterior, simulation, and bootstrap inference methods.

* `avg_time()` estimates average total time in separate or pooled states, using
  visit sums or mapped elapsed-time integration. It supports conditional and
  unconditional analytical variance, posterior intervals, and all existing
  simulation and bootstrap methods. Use `vcov()` for analytical covariance and
  `get_draws()` for retained time-total draws.

* With `time_map` and no `target_times`, `avg_comparisons(estimand =
  "time_in_state")` (and `"time_benefit"`) and `time_in_state()` for SOP data
  frames now integrate from `baseline_time`
  (default `0`) to the last mapped visit, including the interval before the
  first visit. Previously, the omitted grid started at the first mapped visit.
  Set `baseline_time = NULL` or supply `target_times` to choose the period.
  `avg_time()` uses the same default.

* When `variables` sets the starting state (for example
  `variables = list(yprev = c("1", "2"))`), real-time summaries from
  `avg_time()`, `avg_comparisons(estimand = "time_in_state")`, and
  `interpolate_sops()` now start each scenario in the set state at
  `baseline_time`. Previously they started from the patients' observed starting
  states. These results support only conditional variance:
  `inferences(method = "delta")` requires `vcov = "conditional"` (or a
  coefficient covariance matrix), and `method = "mvn"` remains available;
  unconditional delta, score-bootstrap, bootstrap, and FWB inference now error.

* `plot_correlation()` and `plot_variogram()` now default to Spearman rank
  correlation for observed data and fitted models, accounting for tied states.
  Use `method = "pearson"` to retain the previous calculation.

* `plot_correlation()` now uses a 0-1 color scale when all available correlations
  are nonnegative, retaining -1 to 1 when negative correlations are present.
  Set `fill_limits` explicitly to keep a common scale across plots.

* Speed up row assembly, grouped summaries, patient bootstrap materialization,
  and baseline selection using data.table internally. Results remain data frames.

* Initial release of Markov Ordinal State Transition modeling tools, migrated
  from markov.misc with its original authorship and GPL license preserved.
* Retain Markov data generation, first- and second-order transition models,
  state occupancy probabilities, treatment comparisons, time in state,
  diagnostics, and analytical, posterior, MVN, and bootstrap inference.
* Remove non-Markov generators, simulation-study and power workflows, Arrow
  sampling, endpoint conversions, competing-risk analyses, and coefficient
  tidiers. The simulation-truth helper `calc_time_in_state_diff()` is also
  excluded; model-based summaries remain available through `time_in_state()`.
* Use Markov-generated data throughout examples, tests, and all nine vignettes.
* `sim_actt2_markov()` supports custom follow-up, including 60 days; the separate
  Brownian-calibrated 60-day generator is excluded.
